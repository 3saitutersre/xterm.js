 How to Convert Word to IEEE Format Online for Free and Save as EPUB  
Word is a popular and widely used word processing software that allows you to create and edit documents in various formats and styles. However, if you are writing a scientific paper or a technical report, you may need to follow a specific format and style that is prescribed by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). IEEE format is a standard format that is used for publications in the fields of engineering, computer science, and electronics. IEEE format has certain rules and guidelines for the layout, structure, citation, and referencing of your document.
  
EPUB is a common and convenient file format that is used for digital books and publications. EPUB stands for Electronic Publication and it is designed to be compatible with various devices and platforms. EPUB files are based on XML and HTML and they can contain text, images, audio, video, and interactive elements. EPUB files can also be easily converted to other formats such as PDF, MOBI, or AZW.
